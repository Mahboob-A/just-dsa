## Problem Categories Descriptions:

1. **Arrays and Strings**: Fundamental data structures used to store and manipulate collections of elements and sequences of characters, respectively.

2. **Binary Search**: An efficient search algorithm used to find the position of a target value within a sorted array.

3. **Concurrency**: The ability of a system to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, often achieved through techniques such as multithreading and multiprocessing.

4. **Graphs**: Abstract data structures consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect them, used to represent relationships between objects.

5. **Intervals**: Representations of continuous ranges of values or time periods.

6. **Math**: Various mathematical algorithms and concepts, including arithmetic operations, number theory, geometry, and more.

7. **Queue**: A data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are added to the back and removed from the front.

8. **Sliding Window**: A technique used to solve problems involving arrays or strings by maintaining a subset of elements within a fixed window size.

9. **Stack**: A data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are added and removed from the same end.

10. **Two Pointers**: A technique used to solve problems by iterating through an array or list using two pointers, often to find a certain pattern or sum.

11. **Backtracking**: A recursive algorithmic technique that involves systematically exploring all possible solutions to a problem by making choices at each step.

12. **Bitwise Operations**: Operations performed on individual bits of binary numbers, commonly used in low-level programming and optimization.

13. **Dynamic Programming**: A technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing the solutions to avoid redundant computations.

14. **Greedy Algorithms**: Algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum solution.

15. **Linked List**: A linear data structure consisting of a sequence of elements where each element points to the next one in the sequence.

16. **Prefix Sums**: A technique used to efficiently calculate cumulative sums of elements in an array.

17. **Sort**: Algorithms used to arrange elements of a list or array in a particular order, such as numerical or lexicographical order.

18. **Time Series**: Data organized in chronological order, often used in statistics, finance, and other fields to analyze trends over time.

Each directory contains its own README.md file with a list of problems specific to that category. Feel free to explore, solve, and contribute to this repository!
