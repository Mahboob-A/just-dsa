# Pointer Tutorial

```go
func main() {
```
- This is the entry point of the program. Execution starts from here.

```go
    var a *Listnode = &Listnode{}
```
- This line declares a pointer variable `a` of type `*Listnode` and initializes it with a new instance of `Listnode` struct.

```go
    b := a
```
- Here, `b` is declared and assigned the value of `a`. Since `a` is a pointer, `b` also points to the same memory location as `a`.

```go
    fmt.Printf("a: %+v and b:%+v\n", a, b)
```
- This line prints the values of `a` and `b` using `Printf` function from the `fmt` package. `%+v` is a formatting directive that prints the values of variables along with their field names.

```go
    b.next = &Listnode{val: 1, next: &Listnode{}}
```
- Here, a new instance of `Listnode` struct is created and assigned to the `next` field of `b`. This creates a linked list with two nodes.

```go
    fmt.Printf("a: %+v and b:%+v\n", a, b)
```
- This line prints the values of `a` and `b` again after modifying `b.next`.

```go
    b = b.next
```
- Now `b` is assigned the value of `b.next`, effectively moving `b` to the next node in the linked list.

```go
    fmt.Printf("a: %+v and b:%+v\n", a, b)
```
- This line prints the values of `a` and `b` after moving `b` to the next node.

```go
    b.next = b.next.next
```
- This line removes the second node from the linked list by skipping over it. `b.next.next` refers to the next node after the current `b.next`.

```go
    fmt.Printf("a: %+v and b:%+v\n", a, b)
```
- This line prints the values of `a` and `b` after removing the second node from the linked list.

```go
    var i int = 42
    p := &i
    q := p
```
- Here, `i` is declared and initialized to `42`. `p` is then assigned the address of `i`, and `q` is assigned the value of `p`. So, `p` and `q` both point to the same memory location as `i`.

```go
    fmt.Println("p=", p)
    fmt.Println("q=", q)
```
- This line prints the values of `p` and `q`, which are memory addresses pointing to `i`.

```go
    var j int = 7
    q = &j
```
- Here, `j` is declared and initialized to `7`. `q` is then reassigned the address of `j`. Now, `q` points to `j` instead of `i`.

```go
    fmt.Println("p=", p)
    fmt.Println("q=", q)
```
- This line prints the values of `p` and `q` again. `p` still points to `i`, while `q` now points to `j`.

```go
    var result []int
    result = append(result, 0)
```
- Here, `result` is declared as a slice of integers. `0` is appended to `result` using the `append` function.

```go
    var results [][]int
    results = append(results, result)
```
- Here, `results` is declared as a slice of slices of integers. `result` is appended to `results` using the `append` function.

```go
    fmt.Println("results", results)
    fmt.Println("result", result)
```
- These lines print the values of `results` and `result`, showing how slices of slices work.

```go
    resultsAlt := make([][]int, 1)
    resultAlt := make([]int, 1)

    resultAlt[0] = 0
    resultsAlt[0] = resultAlt
```
- These lines achieve the same thing as the previous ones but using the `make` function to create slices.

```go
    fmt.Println("resultsAlt", resultsAlt)
    fmt.Println("resultAlt", resultAlt)
```
- These lines print the values of `resultsAlt` and `resultAlt`, demonstrating the same result as before but using `make`.
