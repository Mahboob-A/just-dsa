# Max Twim Sum in Linked List

## Intuition
The problem asks us to find the maximum sum of pairs of nodes in a linked list. We can achieve this by reversing the middle portion of the linked list and then traversing both the original and reversed linked lists simultaneously to calculate the sum of corresponding pairs.

## Approach
1. Find the middle portion of the linked list using the two-pointer technique.
2. Reverse the middle portion of the linked list.
3. Traverse both the original and reversed linked lists simultaneously.
4. Calculate the sum of corresponding pairs of nodes and update the maximum sum accordingly.
5. Return the maximum sum found.

## Time Complexity
- Finding the middle portion of the linked list: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- Reversing the middle portion: O(n/2) = O(n), as we reverse half of the linked list.
- Traversing the linked lists and calculating the sum: O(n/2) = O(n), as we traverse half of the linked lists.
- Overall time complexity: O(n).

## Space Complexity
- We are using only a constant amount of extra space.
- Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).
