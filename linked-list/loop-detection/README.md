# Problem: Linked List Cycle

## Intuition:
The problem requires determining whether a given linked list contains a cycle. We can efficiently solve this problem using the Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm, also known as the two-pointer technique.

## Approach:
We initialize two pointers `slow` and `fast` to the head of the linked list. We move `fast` two steps ahead and `slow` one step ahead in each iteration. If the linked list contains a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer within the cycle. If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list, and we return false.

## Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. In the worst case, we traverse the entire list once.

## Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) since we only use two pointers regardless of the input size.
