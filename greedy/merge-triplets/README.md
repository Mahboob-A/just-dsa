# Palindrome Partitioning 
You are given a set of triplets `triplets` and a target triplet `target`. You need to determine whether it's possible to construct the target triplet by choosing one element from each triplet in `triplets`.

## Intuition
The intuition behind this problem is to adopt a greedy approach. We iterate through each triplet in `triplets` and compare it with the target triplet `target`. If any element in the triplet from `triplets` is greater than the corresponding element in `target`, we discard that triplet. Then, we check if it's possible to construct each element of the target triplet by choosing an element from the remaining valid triplets.

## Approach
1. Iterate through each triplet in `triplets`.
2. For each triplet, check if any element in the triplet is greater than the corresponding element in `target`. If yes, discard that triplet.
3. Create a boolean array `result` of length 3 to store whether it's possible to construct each element of the target triplet.
4. Iterate through each element position in the target triplet:
   - Iterate through the remaining valid triplets.
   - If the element in the current position of the target triplet matches the element in the current position of a valid triplet, mark that position as true in the `result` array.
5. Return true if all positions in the `result` array are true, indicating that it's possible to construct the target triplet. Otherwise, return false.

## Time Complexity
- Let `n` be the number of triplets.
- The time complexity of the `mergeTriplets` function is O(n) because we iterate through each triplet in `triplets` and perform constant-time operations for each triplet.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity of the `mergeTriplets` function is O(n) because we store the remaining valid triplets in the `candidates` array, which can contain at most `n` elements. Additionally, we use a boolean array `result` of constant size 3.
