## Problem Statement
Given a string `s` containing only three types of characters: '(', ')' and '*', the task is to determine whether the string is a valid combination of parentheses.

## Intuition
The algorithm maintains two variables, `leftMin` and `leftMax`, which represent the minimum and maximum possible counts of unmatched left parentheses encountered while traversing the string, respectively. These counts are updated based on the current character being processed. If at any point, `leftMax` becomes negative, it indicates an irrecoverable situation where the count of right parentheses exceeds the count of remaining unmatched left parentheses and wildcards. On the other hand, if `leftMin` becomes negative, it can be rectified by treating one of the previous wildcards as an empty string. This approach ensures that the string's validity is continuously monitored and maintained throughout the traversal.

## Approach
1. Initialize variables `leftMin` and `leftMax` to track the minimum and maximum counts of unmatched left parentheses encountered, both initially set to 0.
2. Iterate over each character `ch` in the string `s`:
   - If `ch` is '(', increment both `leftMin` and `leftMax`.
   - If `ch` is ')', decrement both `leftMin` and `leftMax`.
   - If `ch` is '*', decrement `leftMin` and increment `leftMax`.
   - Check if `leftMax` is negative. If so, return `false`, as it indicates an irrecoverable situation.
   - If `leftMin` becomes negative at any point, reset it to 0. This allows revisiting previous wildcard patterns and treating them as empty strings to maintain the string's validity.
3. After processing all characters, check if `leftMin` is equal to 0. If so, return `true`, indicating that the string is valid. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we traverse the string only once.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) since it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
