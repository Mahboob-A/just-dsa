# Subsets with no duplicates

Given an integer array `nums` that may contain duplicates, the task is to return all possible subsets (the power set) of `nums`. The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

**Intuition:**
To generate all possible subsets without duplicates, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS) with backtracking. We'll track the frequency of each element using a frequency map. During each iteration of DFS, we'll consider whether to include the current element in the subset based on its frequency and the elements already present in the subset.

**Approach:**
1. Initialize an empty result slice to store all subsets.
2. Create a frequency map (`freq`) to track the count of each element in `nums`.
3. Perform DFS with backtracking:
   - At each step, append the current subset to the result.
   - Iterate over each unique element (`num`) in the frequency map:
     - Skip forming the subset if either the frequency of `num` is 0 or the last element in the current subset is greater than `num`. This avoids duplicate subsets.
     - Otherwise, append `num` to the subset, decrement its count in the frequency map, and recursively call DFS.
     - After the recursive call, backtrack by removing `num` from the subset and restoring its count in the frequency map.
4. Return the result containing all generated subsets.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of the DFS algorithm is O(2^N), where N is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because each element has two choices: either include it or exclude it from the subset.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is also O(2^N) due to the recursive stack space and the space required to store the result.


## Remark

The condition `len(subset) > 0 && subset[len(subset)-1] > num` exists to skip forming subsets that would result in duplicates. Let's break down why this condition is necessary:

1. **Duplicates Handling**: When generating subsets, especially with duplicates, we want to avoid forming subsets that are already generated.
   
2. **Sorted Nature of Frequencies**: The frequencies of numbers in the input array `nums` are stored in a map, which ensures that during iteration, we encounter numbers in ascending order of magnitude.

3. **Sorted Order of Subset Elements**: Due to the sorted nature of the frequencies, when we build subsets recursively, the elements in each subset are always in sorted order.

4. **Avoiding Duplicates**: To avoid duplicates, we want to ensure that we do not consider adding a number to the current subset if it's smaller than or equal to the last element in the subset. If we allow such additions, we risk forming subsets that are already generated.

   - For example, if we have a subset `[1, 2]` and encounter the number `1` again, adding `1` to this subset would result in `[1, 2, 1]`. However, this subset is already formed earlier when we encountered `1` for the first time, resulting in `[1, 1, 2]`.
   
5. **Ensuring Unique Subsets**: By checking if the current number `num` is less than or equal to the last element in the subset, we can ensure that the subsets formed are unique and do not overlap with previously generated subsets.

6. **Skipping Conditions**: 
   - `len(subset) > 0`: Ensures that the subset is not empty before checking the last element.
   - `subset[len(subset)-1] > num`: Compares the last element in the subset with the current number. If the last element is greater than `num`, it means that subsets with `num` have already been formed, so we skip adding `num` to the current subset.

Overall, this condition optimizes the algorithm by avoiding unnecessary recursive calls and ensures that only unique subsets are generated.
