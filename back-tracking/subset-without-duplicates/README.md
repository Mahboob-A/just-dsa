# Subsets with no duplicates

Given an integer array `nums` that may contain duplicates, the task is to return all possible subsets (the power set) of `nums`. The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

**Intuition:**
To generate all possible subsets without duplicates, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS) with backtracking. We'll track the frequency of each element using a frequency map. During each iteration of DFS, we'll consider whether to include the current element in the subset based on its frequency and the elements already present in the subset.

**Approach:**
1. Initialize an empty result slice to store all subsets.
2. Create a frequency map (`freq`) to track the count of each element in `nums`.
3. Perform DFS with backtracking:
   - At each step, append the current subset to the result.
   - Iterate over each unique element (`num`) in the frequency map:
     - Skip forming the subset if either the frequency of `num` is 0 or the last element in the current subset is greater than `num`. This avoids duplicate subsets.
     - Otherwise, append `num` to the subset, decrement its count in the frequency map, and recursively call DFS.
     - After the recursive call, backtrack by removing `num` from the subset and restoring its count in the frequency map.
4. Return the result containing all generated subsets.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of the DFS algorithm is O(2^N), where N is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because each element has two choices: either include it or exclude it from the subset.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is also O(2^N) due to the recursive stack space and the space required to store the result.


## Remark

This condition `len(subset) > 0 && subset[len(subset)-1] > num` is intended to skip forming subsets when the last element in the current subset is greater than the current number `num` during the depth-first search (DFS) traversal. 

Here's why this condition is used:

1. **Avoiding Duplicate Subsets**: In a DFS approach to generate subsets, we iterate through the elements of the input array and recursively explore two possibilities for each element: including it in the subset or excluding it. However, when we encounter duplicate elements, we want to avoid forming duplicate subsets.

2. **Ensuring Unique Subsets**: By checking if `len(subset) > 0 && subset[len(subset)-1] > num`, we're ensuring that subsets are formed in a sorted order. If the last element in the current subset (`subset[len(subset)-1]`) is greater than the current number `num`, it implies that the subsets containing `num` have already been formed in previous iterations. Therefore, we skip forming subsets in such cases to avoid duplicates.

3. **Optimization**: This condition helps optimize the DFS traversal by avoiding unnecessary recursive calls and redundant subset formations, improving the efficiency of the algorithm.

Overall, this condition ensures that only unique subsets are generated during the DFS traversal, avoiding duplicates and optimizing the subset generation process.
