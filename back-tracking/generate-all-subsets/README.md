# Backtracking

Generate all possible subsets of a given array of unique elements.

## Intuition:
The problem of generating all possible subsets can be effectively solved using a backtracking approach. By exploring all possible combinations of elements in the array, we can generate all subsets.

## Approach:
1. Define a recursive function `generateSubsets(nums, subset, result, startIdx)`, which takes the current `nums` array, the current `subset`, the `result` slice of all subsets, and the `startIdx` indicating the starting index to consider in `nums`.
2. At each step of the recursion:
   - Add the current `subset` to the `result`.
   - Iterate over the elements of `nums` starting from `startIdx`.
   - For each element at index `i`, add `nums[i]` to the `subset` and recursively call `generateSubsets` with `startIdx = i + 1`.
   - After the recursive call, backtrack by removing the last element from the `subset`.
3. Finally, call `generateSubsets` with the initial parameters: `nums`, an empty `subset`, an empty `result`, and `startIdx = 0`.

## Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(2^n), where n is the number of elements in the input array `nums`. This is because there are 2^n possible subsets, and each subset requires O(n) time to generate.

## Space Complexity:
The space complexity is also O(2^n) in the worst case, as there can be a total of 2^n subsets, each with an average size of O(n). Additionally, the recursive call stack can have a depth of O(n) in the worst case.


## Remark

The line `subset = subset[:len(subset)-1]` is significant because it removes the last element from the subset. In the context of backtracking algorithms, this line is used to backtrack or undo the inclusion of the current element in the subset before exploring other possibilities.

Here's why this line is important:

1. **Backtracking**: After including an element in the subset and exploring all possible combinations with that element included, we need to backtrack to explore other combinations where that element is not included. Backtracking involves removing the last element added to the subset so that we can explore other branches of the recursion tree.

2. **Preparation for Next Iteration**: In the recursive function `backtrack`, after processing the current element and its subsets, we remove the last element from the `subset` before moving on to the next iteration. This prepares the `subset` for the next recursive call, ensuring that we correctly build subsets without the current element for the subsequent iterations.

3. **Maintaining State**: By removing the last element from the `subset`, we revert it to the state it was in before adding the current element. This ensures that we explore all possible combinations of elements without duplicates and without missing any combination.

In summary, the line `subset = subset[:len(subset)-1]` plays a crucial role in backtracking algorithms by allowing us to backtrack and explore different combinations of elements while constructing subsets.
