# Minimum Size Subarray Sum

Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, return the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.

## Intuition

- We'll use a sliding window approach to find the minimal length of the subarray. 
- We'll initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to define the window boundaries.
- As we move the `right` pointer, we'll expand the window until the sum of elements inside the window is less than `target`.
- Once the sum is greater than or equal to `target`, we'll try to minimize the window size by moving the `left` pointer.

## Approach

1. Initialize `left` and `right` pointers to 0.
2. Initialize a variable `windowSum` to store the sum of elements within the window.
3. Initialize `length` to `math.MaxInt32` to represent the minimal length of the subarray.
4. Iterate through the array using the `right` pointer:
   - Add the current element to `windowSum`.
   - If `windowSum` is greater than or equal to `target`, enter a loop to minimize the window size:
     - Update `length` with the minimum length of the subarray found so far.
     - Subtract the element at the `left` pointer from `windowSum` and increment `left`.
5. Return `length`, which represents the minimal length of the subarray.

## Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `nums` array.

## Space Complexity:

The space complexity is O(1) since we are using only a constant amount of extra space.
