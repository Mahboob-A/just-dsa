# Problem Statement
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, you can perform at most `k` operations to replace any character in the string with any other character. Find the length of the longest substring containing the same character after performing these operations.

## Intuition
- We can use a sliding window approach to find the longest substring with the same character after performing at most `k` operations.
- We maintain a window represented by the variables `l` and `r`, where `l` is the left boundary of the window and `r` is the right boundary.
- We use a map `countWindow` to keep track of the frequency of characters in the current window.
- We update the maximum count of a character `maxCount` and calculate the number of operations required to make all characters in the window the same.
- If the number of operations exceeds `k`, we shrink the window from the left.
- We continuously update the length of the longest substring as we iterate through the string.

## Approach
1. Initialize an empty map `countWindow` to keep track of the frequency of characters in the current window.
2. Initialize variables `maxCount` and `maxLength` to keep track of the maximum count of a character in the window and the length of the longest substring with the same character, respectively.
3. Initialize variable `l` to 0 as the left boundary of the window.
4. Iterate over the string `s` using a pointer `r`:
    - Update the count of character `s[r]` in the window.
    - Update `maxCount` to the maximum of its current value and the count of character `s[r]` in the window.
    - Calculate the number of operations required to make all characters in the window the same: `(r - l + 1) - maxCount`.
    - If the number of operations exceeds `k`, shrink the window from the left by updating the count of character `s[l]` in the window and incrementing `l`.
    - Update `maxLength` to the maximum of its current value and the length of the current substring (`r - l + 1`).
5. Return `maxLength` as the result.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`, as we iterate over each character in the string once.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of this approach is O(1), as the size of the map `countWindow` is bounded by the number of characters in the English alphabet (constant space).
