# Frequency of the Most Frequent Element

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can choose an index of `nums` and increment the element at that index by 1. Return the maximum possible frequency of an element after performing at most `k` operations.

## Intuition:

To maximize the frequency of an element, we can try to make as many elements in the array equal to the maximum element in the array. This approach minimizes the difference between the maximum and other elements in the array.

## Approach:

1. Sort the array `nums` in non-decreasing order.
2. Initialize two pointers `l` and `r` to denote the left and right ends of a sliding window.
3. Iterate through the array with the right pointer `r`.
4. Update the sum of elements in the current window.
5. Check if the maximum achievable sum in the current window ( `(r - l + 1) * nums[r]` ) exceeds the sum of elements in the current window plus `k`.
6. If the condition is true, shrink the window by moving the left pointer `l` to the right until the condition is false.
7. Update the maximum frequency with the length of the current window `(r - l + 1)`.
8. Return the maximum frequency.

## Time Complexity:** \(O(n \log n)\) - Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\) time, where \(n\) is the size of the array. The subsequent linear scan through the array takes \(O(n)\) time.

## Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) - Constant extra space is used.
