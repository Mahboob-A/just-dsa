# Problem: Rotate String

## Intuition:
The problem requires determining if one string can be obtained by rotating another string. We can solve this problem by checking if the given string is a substring of the concatenation of itself. If it is, then it can be obtained by rotating the other string.

## Approach:
1. Check if the length of the given string `s` is greater than the length of the target string `goal`. If it is, return false because `s` cannot be obtained by rotating `goal`.
2. Concatenate `goal` with itself (`goal + goal`) and check if `s` is a substring of this concatenation using the `isSubString` function.
3. The `isSubString` function checks if `shortStr` is a substring of `longStr` using a fixed window approach:
   - If the lengths of `shortStr` and `longStr` are not equal, return false.
   - If `shortStr` is equal to `longStr`, return true.
   - Initialize a fixed window of size `m` (length of `shortStr`) in `longStr`.
   - Check if the fixed window is equal to `shortStr`. If it is, return true.
   - Slide the fixed window along `longStr` and check if any substring matches `shortStr`.
4. If `shortStr` is found as a substring of `longStr`, return true; otherwise, return false.

## Time Complexity:
- `O(m*n)`, where n is the length of the longest string. 


The time complexity of the `isSubString` function depends on the length of the input strings `shortStr` and `longStr`. Here's the breakdown:

1. The initial check to compare the lengths of `shortStr` and `longStr` takes O(1) time.
2. Comparing `shortStr` and `longStr` for equality in the second if statement takes O(m) time, where m is the length of `shortStr`.
3. The initialization of the fixed window in `longStr` (`subStr := longStr[0:m]`) also takes O(m) time.
4. The loop iterates over each character in `longStr` once. Inside the loop:
   - **Slicing the substring `longStr[i-m+1:i+1]` takes O(m) time.**
   - Comparing `shortStr` with the sliced substring takes O(m) time.
   - The loop runs for (n - m) iterations, where n is the length of `longStr`.
   - So, the total time complexity inside the loop is O((n - m) * m).

Combining all these steps, the overall time complexity of the `isSubString` function is:

O(1) + O(m) + O(m) + O((n - m) * m) = O(n * m)

where n is the length of `longStr` and m is the length of `shortStr`.

## Space Complexity:
- `O(1)`. We use only a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
