# Problem: Set Matrix Zeroes

## Intuition:
The problem requires setting the entire row and column of a matrix to zero if any element in that row or column is zero. We can solve this efficiently by using the first row and first column of the matrix to mark the rows and columns that need to be zeroed.

## Approach:
1. Initialize two boolean variables `firstRowHasZero` and `firstColHasZero` to keep track of whether the first row and first column contain zeros, respectively.
2. Iterate through the matrix to identify if the first row and first column contain any zeros.
3. Traverse the matrix except for the first row and first column. For each zero element `(i, j)`, set the corresponding elements in the first row and first column to zero.
4. Iterate through the first row and first column to nullify the rows and columns based on the zero entries.
5. Nullify the first row and first column if necessary based on the initial checks.

## Time Complexity:
- O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix. We traverse the entire matrix once.

## Space Complexity:
- O(1). We use only a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
