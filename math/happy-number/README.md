# Happy Number
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.
A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy. Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

## Intuition
To determine if a number is happy, we can use Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm, also known as the "tortoise and hare" algorithm. We iterate through the process of replacing the number by the sum of the squares of its digits until we either reach 1 (in which case the number is happy) or detect a cycle (in which case the number is not happy).

## Approach
1. Define a function `nextNumber` to compute the sum of the squares of the digits of a number.
2. Initialize two pointers `slow` and `fast` to `n`.
3. In a loop, move `slow` one step forward and `fast` two steps forward using the `nextNumber` function.
4. If `slow` equals 1, return true (n is a happy number).
5. If `slow` equals `fast`, indicating a cycle, return false (n is not a happy number).
6. Continue iterating until reaching one of the termination conditions.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(log n), where n is the number being checked for happiness. This is because the algorithm terminates for all numbers, and in the worst case, it takes log n steps to reach 1 or detect a cycle.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) since we use only a constant amount of extra space for storing variables.


## Remark - Time Complexity Analysis:

1. **Next Number Calculation**: The `nextNumber` function iterates over the digits of the given number and computes the sum of the squares of these digits. The number of digits in the given number `n` can be at most O(log n) (where the base of the logarithm is 10). Therefore, the time complexity of computing the next number is O(log n).

2. **Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm**: The main loop of the `isHappy` function uses Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm to determine if the number eventually reaches 1 (a happy number) or falls into a cycle (a non-happy number). In the worst case, where the number is a non-happy number and keeps cycling endlessly, the loop will run until a cycle is detected. This loop iterates through the sequence of numbers generated by the `nextNumber` function. Since the sequence generated by `nextNumber` has a cycle length bounded by O(log n) (as it is based on the digits of the number), the loop will run for at most O(log n) iterations.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the `isHappy` function is dominated by the computation of the next number and the Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm, both of which have a time complexity of O(log n). Thus, the total time complexity of the `isHappy` function is O(log n).

In summary, the `isHappy` function has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the given number.
