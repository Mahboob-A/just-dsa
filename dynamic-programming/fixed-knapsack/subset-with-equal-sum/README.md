# Partition Equal Subset Sum
Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if you can partition the array into two subsets such that the sum of the elements in both subsets is equal or `false` otherwise.

## Intuition
The problem involves partitioning an array into two subsets such that both subsets have equal sums. We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this efficiently.

## Approach
1. Calculate the total sum of all elements in the array. If the sum is odd, it's impossible to divide the array into two subsets with equal sums. Return `false` in this case.
2. If the sum is even, we aim to find whether there's a subset whose sum is equal to half of the total sum. We use dynamic programming to build a 2D grid `dp[i][j]`, where `i` represents the number of elements considered so far and `j` represents the target sum.
3. Initialize the DP grid such that `dp[i][0] = true` (for any number of elements, it's possible to achieve a sum of 0). For the first row, `dp[0][j] = false` (it's not possible to achieve a non-zero sum with 0 elements).
4. Fill up the DP grid. For each element `nums[i]`, iterate through the possible target sums `j`. If `nums[i] <= j`, we can choose whether to include `nums[i]` in the subset or not. If included, check if it's possible to achieve the remaining sum `j - nums[i]` with the previous elements. Update `dp[i][j]` accordingly.
5. At the end, return `dp[n][m]`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array and `m` is half of the total sum.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n * m), where `n` is the number of elements in the array and `m` is the target sum (half of the total sum).

## Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(n * m) as well, due to the 2D DP grid used to store the intermediate results.
