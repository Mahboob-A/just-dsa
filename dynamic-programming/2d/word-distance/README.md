# Word distance
Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`. The allowed operations are:
- Insert a character
- Delete a character
- Replace a character

## Intuition
This problem can be solved using bottom-up dynamic programming. We can define a 2D array `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of operations required to convert the substring of `word1` ending at index `i` to the substring of `word2` ending at index `j`.

## Approach
1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `(m+1)*(n+1)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `word1` and `word2`, respectively.
2. Base case:
   - `dp[0][0] = 0`: The minimum number of operations required to convert an empty string to another empty string is 0.
   - `dp[i][0] = i`: The minimum number of operations required to convert the first `i` characters of `word1` to an empty string (i.e., delete all characters).
   - `dp[0][j] = j`: The minimum number of operations required to convert an empty string to the first `j` characters of `word2` (i.e., insert all characters).
3. Fill up the DP array:
   - If `word1[i-1]` matches `word2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]` because no operation is needed.
   - Otherwise, take the minimum of the following three operations:
     - Insertion: `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + 1`
     - Deletion: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + 1`
     - Replacement: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`
   - Increment the minimum of these three operations by 1 because we are definitely going to perform at least one operation (insertion, deletion, or replacement).
4. Return `dp[m][n]`, which represents the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of `word1` and `word2`, respectively.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of `word1` and `word2`, respectively, due to the 2D DP array.
