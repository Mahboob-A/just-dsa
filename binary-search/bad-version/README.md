**Problem Statement:**
Given a range of versions from 1 to n and a function `isBadVersion(version int) bool` that returns true if the given version is bad and false if it is good, find the first bad version.

**Intuition:**
Since the versions are sorted, we can use binary search to efficiently find the first bad version. By making intelligent adjustments to the search space based on the results of the `isBadVersion` function, we can converge to the first bad version.

The intuition behind the logic of binary search, including the two pointers crossing, lies in the understanding of how binary search operates efficiently by halving the search space with each iteration.

In binary search:
- We start with a range of elements (in this case, versions) and check the middle element.
- If the middle element is the target, we're done.
- If the middle element is greater than the target, we narrow our search to the left half of the range.
- If the middle element is less than the target, we narrow our search to the right half of the range.

The key insight is that if we have a sorted list, we can discard half of the elements at each step. This way, with each iteration, we effectively halve the size of the search space. This property allows binary search to be very efficient, typically achieving a time complexity of O(log n).

Regarding the two pointers crossing:
- Initially, we have one pointer at the start of the range (`l`) and another at the end of the range (`r`).
- As we perform binary search iterations, we update these pointers to narrow down the search space.
- When the search space is fully narrowed down and there are no elements left to search (i.e., `l` crosses `r`), it signifies that we have found the answer or determined that the target does not exist in the range.

The crossing of the two pointers (`l` and `r`) signifies the termination of the search process. At this point:
- If we have found the target, the final value of `l` (or `r`) will be the index of the target.
- If the target does not exist in the range, the final value of `l` and `r` will be such that `l > r`, indicating that the search space is empty.

In the context of the "first bad version" problem, once `l` crosses `r`, we know that `l` points to the first bad version, and we return `l` as the answer.


**Approach:**
1. Initialize two pointers, `l` and `r`, to the start and end of the range of versions, respectively.
2. While `l` is less than or equal to `r`, perform binary search:
    - Calculate the middle version `mid` as `l + (r-l)/2`.
    - Check if the middle version is bad:
        - If it is bad, update `r` to `mid - 1` (search left half).
        - If it is not bad, update `l` to `mid + 1` (search right half).
3. Once the loop exits, `l` will point to the first bad version and `r` will point to the latest good version.
4. Return `l` as the first bad version.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log n) since we perform binary search on a range of n versions.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space for variables regardless of the size of the input.


**Example**
Let's consider a simple example with a range of versions from 1 to 8, and we want to find the first bad version. Assume that versions 5, 6, 7, and 8 are bad versions, and versions 1, 2, 3, and 4 are good versions.

Here's how the algorithm works step by step:

1. Initially, `l = 1` and `r = 8`.

2. **Iteration 1:**
   - `mid = (1 + 8) / 2 = 4`. We check if version 4 is bad or not:
     - `isBadVersion(4)` returns false.
     - Since version 4 is not bad, we update `l = 4 + 1 = 5`.

3. **Iteration 2:**
   - `mid = (5 + 8) / 2 = 6`. We check if version 6 is bad or not:
     - `isBadVersion(6)` returns true.
     - Since version 6 is bad, we update `r = 6 - 1 = 5`.

4. **Iteration 3:**
   - `mid = (5 + 5) / 2 = 5`. We check if version 5 is bad or not:
     - `isBadVersion(5)` returns true.
     - Since version 5 is bad, we update `r = 5 - 1 = 4`.

5. **Loop Exit:**
   - At this point, `l > r` is true, so the loop exits.
   - `l = 5`, and `r = 4`.

6. Since `l` now points to the first bad version, which is version 5, we return `l`, i.e., 5.

Thus, in this example, the first bad version is correctly identified as version 5 using the binary search algorithm.
