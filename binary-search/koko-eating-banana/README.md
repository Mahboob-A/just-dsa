# Koko eating bananas

Koko loves eating bananas. She has a set of banana piles represented by the `piles` array, where each element `piles[i]` indicates the number of bananas in the `i`-th pile. Koko needs to determine the minimum eating speed `k` so that she can consume all the bananas within `h` hours. If Koko eats `k` bananas per hour from a pile, any remaining bananas in that pile are discarded. Koko can only eat from one pile per hour.

**Intuition**:
The problem requires finding the minimum eating speed `k` that allows Koko to consume all the bananas within the given time constraint `h`. We can use binary search to efficiently search for the optimal eating speed `k`. By defining a search space for `k` and iteratively narrowing it down based on whether Koko can consume all the bananas within `h` hours at a given speed, we can find the minimum `k`.

**Approach**:
1. Define the search space for `k` as `[1, max(piles)]`, where `max(piles)` represents the maximum number of bananas in any pile.
2. Perform binary search within the defined search space to find the minimum eating speed `k`.
3. Within each iteration of the binary search:
   - Calculate the midpoint `mid` of the current search space.
   - Check if Koko can eat all the bananas within `h` hours at the current eating speed `mid`.
   - If Koko can eat all the bananas within `h` hours, update the right pointer `r` to `mid - 1` to search for smaller values of `k`. Otherwise, update the left pointer `l` to `mid + 1` to search for larger values of `k`.
4. Return the left pointer `l` as the minimum eating speed `k`.

**Time Complexity**:
- The binary search algorithm has a time complexity of `O(log(max(piles)) * n)`, where `n` is the number of piles.
- Within each iteration of the binary search, the `canEatAll` function is called to check if Koko can eat all the bananas within `h` hours, which takes O(n) time. Therefore, the total time complexity is O(log(max(piles)) * n).

**Space Complexity**:
- The space complexity is O(1) since we use only a constant amount of extra space for variables and calculations, irrespective of the input size.
