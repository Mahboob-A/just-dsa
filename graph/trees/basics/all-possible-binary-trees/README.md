# All possible full binary trees 
Given an integer `n`, return a list of all possible full binary trees with `n` nodes. Each node of each tree in the answer must have `Node.Val == 0`. Each element of the answer is the root node of one possible tree. You may return the final list of trees in any order. A full binary tree is a binary tree where each node has exactly 0 or 2 children.

### Intuition
We use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to generate all possible full binary trees with `n` nodes. We represent the number of unique full binary trees with `i` nodes using a dynamic programming array `dp[i]`.

### Approach
1. **Base Case**: If `n` is even, it's impossible to form a full binary tree, so return nil.
2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: Initialize a dynamic programming array `dp` of type `[][]*TreeNode`, where `dp[i]` represents the list of unique full binary trees with `i` nodes.
3. **Base Tree**: Create a base tree with a single node having `Val` set to 0.
4. **Loop**: Starting from `i = 3`, iterate up to `n` in steps of 2 (as only odd values of `n` can form full binary trees).
5. **Subtrees Combination**:
   - Iterate over possible values of `j` (from 1 to `i-1`, as 1 node is reserved for the root).
   - For each value of `j`, retrieve all possible left subtrees with `j` nodes (`dp[j]`) and right subtrees with `i-j-1` nodes (`dp[i-j-1]`).
   - Combine each left subtree with each right subtree to form full binary trees with `i` nodes.
6. **Storing Results**: Store the list of generated full binary trees with `i` nodes in the `dp` array (`dp[i]`).
7. **Return**: Finally, return `dp[n]`, which contains the list of all possible full binary trees with `n` nodes.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2), where n is the given input integer.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this approach is O(n^2), as we store the list of unique full binary trees with each number of nodes from 1 to n.
