# Flip Equivalent 
Given two binary trees, determine if they are flip equivalent. Two binary trees are flip equivalent if they satisfy the condition that one tree can be transformed into the other by a series of flip operations, where a flip operation involves swapping the left and right subtrees of a node.

## Intuition
The key idea behind the solution is to solve this problem recursively by breaking it down into independent subproblems. The essence lies in the fact that we cannot flip the root itself but only its left and right subtrees. For the entire tree to be flip equivalent, its left and right subtrees must also be flip equivalent.

## Approach
- **Base Cases**: If both trees are empty (nil), they are flip equivalent. Return true.
- If one of the trees is nil while the other is not, or if the values of the roots are different, they are not flip equivalent. Return false.
- Recursively check if the left subtrees of both trees are flip equivalent and if their right subtrees are flip equivalent. If both conditions are true, or if the left subtree of one tree is flip equivalent to the right subtree of the other tree, and vice versa, return true; otherwise, return false.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we visit each node once in the worst case scenario.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity of this approach is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree. This is because the space required for the recursive call stack is proportional to the height of the tree.
