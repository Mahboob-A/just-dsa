# Diameter of a Binary Tree 

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

## Intuition

To find the diameter of a binary tree, we need to consider all possible paths between any two nodes in the tree. However, the path may or may not pass through the root node. Hence, we need to explore all nodes of the tree and calculate the length of the longest path that passes through each node. The maximum of these lengths will be the diameter of the tree.

## Approach

1. Define a helper function `dfs` that recursively calculates the depth of each subtree **rooted at the node passed to it** and updates the diameter if necessary.
2. Initialize the diameter variable to track the maximum diameter found so far.
3. In the `dfs` function:
   - If the current node is nil, return 0.
   - Recursively calculate the depth of the left subtree and the right subtree.
   - Update the diameter with the sum of the depths of the left and right subtrees.
   - Return the depth of the current subtree as 1 plus the maximum depth of its left and right subtrees.
4. Invoke the `dfs` function starting from the root node and update the diameter as necessary.
5. Return the diameter.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We traverse each node of the tree once during the depth-first search.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity of this approach is O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree. This space is used for the recursive call stack during the depth-first search traversal. In the worst case, the height of the binary tree is equal to the number of nodes in the tree, resulting in O(N) space complexity.
