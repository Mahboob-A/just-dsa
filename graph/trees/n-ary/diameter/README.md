# [Diamter of n-ary tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-n-ary-tree/description/)
Calculate the diameter of an n-ary tree. The diameter of a tree is defined as the number of nodes on the longest path between any two nodes in the tree.

## Intuition
To find the diameter of an n-ary tree, we need to calculate the maximum distance between any two nodes in the tree. We can achieve this by recursively traversing the tree and keeping track of the maximum and second maximum depths of each node's subtree. By adding these two depths together for each node, we can determine the diameter of the tree.

## Approach
1. Define a `Node` struct to represent a node in the n-ary tree. Each node should have an integer value and a slice of pointers to its children nodes.
2. Implement a function `diameter(root *Node) int` to calculate the diameter of the tree.
3. Use depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree recursively.
4. During traversal, keep track of the maximum and second maximum depths of each node's subtree.
5. Update the diameter variable whenever the sum of the maximum and second maximum depths of a node's subtree exceeds the current diameter.
6. Return the calculated diameter.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the n-ary tree. This is because we perform a depth-first traversal of the tree, visiting each node once.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of this approach is also O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the n-ary tree. This space is used for the recursive call stack during depth-first traversal. Additionally, the space complexity includes the space required for maintaining variables and data structures used in the algorithm.
