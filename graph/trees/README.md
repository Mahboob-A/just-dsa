# Trees vs Graphs

Trees and graphs are both data structures used to represent relationships between entities, but they have some fundamental differences:

1. **Acyclic vs. Cyclic:** One of the main differences between trees and graphs is that trees are always acyclic, meaning there are no cycles (loops) in a tree structure. On the other hand, graphs can be cyclic or acyclic. Cyclic graphs contain cycles, where a sequence of edges can be followed to return to the same node, while acyclic graphs do not contain cycles.

2. **Hierarchical vs. Non-hierarchical:** Trees are hierarchical data structures where nodes are organized in a top-down manner with a single root node and each node having zero or more child nodes. Graphs, on the other hand, can be non-hierarchical and represent arbitrary relationships between nodes without any strict parent-child hierarchy.

3. **Root Node:** Trees have a single root node from which all other nodes are descended. This root node has no parent. In contrast, graphs do not have a concept of a root node. Nodes in a graph can have any number of incoming and outgoing edges, and there is no designated starting point like in a tree.

4. **Connectivity:** Trees are connected graphs, meaning that there is a path between any pair of nodes in the tree. Additionally, removing any edge from a tree will disconnect the tree. In graphs, however, connectivity varies. Some graphs may be fully connected (every node can be reached from every other node), while others may have disconnected components.

5. **Degree:** In a tree, each node has at most one parent and zero or more children. The number of children a node can have is its degree. In a graph, the degree of a node refers to the number of edges incident to that node, which may vary depending on the type of graph (directed or undirected).

6. **Specific Properties:** Trees often have specific properties like binary trees (each node has at most two children) or binary search trees (nodes are ordered such that the left child is less than the parent and the right child is greater). Graphs have various classifications based on properties such as directedness, weightedness, and connectivity (e.g., directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted, connected/disconnected).

In summary, **trees are a specific type of graph with certain structural constraints, including acyclicity, hierarchical organization, and a single root node**. Graphs, on the other hand, are more general structures that can represent a wide range of relationships, including those with cycles and non-hierarchical connections.

## Example

Let's analyze the given graph:

```
[[0, 1],   // Edge from node 0 to node 1
 [0, 2],   // Edge from node 0 to node 2
 [1, 2]]   // Edge from node 1 to node 2
```

This graph has the following properties:

1. **Acyclic:** There are no cycles in the graph, as there is no way to traverse from a node back to itself by following the directed edges.

2. **Connected:** The graph is not fully connected because there is no direct edge from node 1 to node 0 or node 2. However, considering the directed nature of the graph, it is a connected directed graph because there is a directed path from any node to any other node.

Based on these observations, the given **graph is not a tree, but it is a connected directed acyclic graph (DAG)**.
